# MAIN CATKIN WORKSPACE

This repository allows one to easily develop new ROS features for the PM08 car in an isolated docker environment. Moreover it is faster to integrate packages, as anyone can add their dependencies to the dockerfile.


## How to use

Run:
```bash
cd /your/path/PUTM_DV_MAIN_CATKIN_WORKSPACE
sudo ./run_container.sh
```

Connect to the container using the "Remote Explorer" extension for VS Code.
